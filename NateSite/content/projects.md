## Leafit

Leafit is an iOS and Android camera app that uses self-teaching image recognition technology to identify photos of leaves. Users can pick up interesting leaves and access useful information about the plants and trees that they come from.  

I am developing the [Android](https://github.com/naheller/Leafit-Android) version while my partner works on the [iOS](https://github.com/alecsavvy/leafit-ios) version.  

More updates to come!
